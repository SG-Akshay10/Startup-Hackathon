# Startup-Hackathon
After dataset is preprocessed, we connect it to the SQL database(PostgreSQL) which eases our machine learning model

the same preprocessed data is used as training dataset for our machine learning algorithm
In this algorithm we take in 2 or more feataures of the data set and derive a similarity matrix comparing those constrains(Cosine similarity)to find the most accurate/similar investors/startups
front end of this project is done mostly with streamlit module of python
database from postgreSQL and streamlit is connceted using psycog2
